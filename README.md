I want to use the VK API

1. It doesn't expire very soon and I can fetch a specific channel everyday
2. I don't actively participate in VK
3. It fetches automatically

Go to: https://id.vk.com/about/business/go

Register an app, get the Access tokens > Service token 

Test if this works: https://api.vk.com/method/wall.get?owner_id=1&count=10&access_token=?????????&v=5.199
